# Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Adriano

Welcome to my blog! I'm a cybersecurity nerd from Bussolengo, Italy, who loves diving deep into threat intel, EDR/XDR platforms, and anything that makes systems more secure (and hackers' lives harder ðŸ˜„). By day, I help secure enterprise environments and hunt down threats. By night, you'll find me tinkering with Raspberry Pis, breaking stuff in labs, or hacking away at challenges on TryHackMe and Hack The Box.

This blog is my little corner of the internet where Iâ€™ll share cool projects, threat hunting tips, lessons learned in the field, and maybe some hardware experiments along the way.

Letâ€™s break things (safely) and learn together.
