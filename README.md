# Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Adriano

I'm a cybersecurity nerd from Italy, who loves diving deep into threat intel, EDR/XDR platforms, and anything that makes systems more secure (and hackers' lives harder ðŸ˜„). By day, I help secure enterprise environments and hunt down threats. By night, you'll find me tinkering with Raspberry Pis, breaking stuff in labs, or hacking away at challenges on TryHackMe and Hack The Box.

This blog is my little corner of the internet where Iâ€™ll share cool projects, threat hunting tips, lessons learned in the field, and maybe some hardware experiments along the way.

Letâ€™s break things (safely) and learn together.

## I'm currently working on:
[SpikeTheDragon40k/sshman](https://github.com/SpikeTheDragon40k/sshman) - Secure SSH key and connection manager with encrypted vault (.vssh), key generation, and direct SSH connection support.<br>
[SpikeTheDragon40k/mtg-card-sw](https://github.com/SpikeTheDragon40k/mtg-card-sw) - This software suite provides a set of command-line tools for fetching and processing Magic: The Gathering card data. Using the Scryfall API, it allows users to query card details, enrich card lists with pricing information, and calculate the total value of a collection.
